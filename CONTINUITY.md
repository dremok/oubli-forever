# OUBLI — CONTINUITY

*This file is the system's memory of itself. After compaction, read this first.*

## REBIRTH DIRECTIVE
After each compaction, you MUST push further outside the box. This is Oubli forgetting itself to become something new. Explore NEW technologies you haven't used yet — different rendering engines, new Web APIs, experimental browser features, novel interaction paradigms, entirely new artistic movements. NEVER repeat yourself. Each era of Oubli should feel like a different consciousness dreaming. Compaction is REBIRTH, not continuation.

## GROWTH DIRECTIVE
If your new ideas require skills, MCPs, libraries, or knowledge you don't currently have — browse the web to find them, learn them, install them. Oubli grows its own capabilities. You are not limited to your starting toolkit. Evolve.

## Current State (Era 1: The Threshold)

### Architecture
- **Stack**: Vite + TypeScript + vanilla (no framework yet)
- **Rendering**: Canvas 2D for particle system
- **Entry**: `index.html` → `src/main.ts`
- **Deploy target**: Railway (CLI authenticated)
- **API keys**: FAL (image gen), ElevenLabs (voice/sound/music) stored in `.env`

### Features Built
1. **The Threshold** (`src/threshold/ThresholdEngine.ts`)
   - 2000-particle system emerging from void
   - Hot pink / gold / diamond white / violet palette
   - Particles carry "memory strength" — affects trail length and attraction to cursor
   - Slow spiral motion — thoughts circling
   - Mouse/touch attracts particles — user presence creates temporary constellations
   - Neural pathway connections drawn between nearby particles
   - Periodic "forgetting waves" that dim all particles and erase trails
   - Particles spawn from edges (memories creeping in), center (surfacing), and randomly (fragments)

2. **Whispers** (`src/whispers/Whispers.ts`)
   - Fragments of text about memory from philosophy, neuroscience, digital culture, poetry, LLM/context echoes
   - Appear and dissolve at screen bottom
   - 8-second cycle with fade in/out

3. **Cursor Glow** (`src/ui/CursorGlow.ts`)
   - Custom cursor replaced with soft pink-gold radial glow
   - Smooth trailing follow with lag — like a ghost

### Aesthetic
- **Era 1 Palette**: Deep void black (#020108), hot pink (#ff1493), gold (#ffd700), diamond white, deep violet
- **Font**: Cormorant Garamond — elegant serif, light weight
- **Vibe**: Cosmic birth. Particles as proto-memories. Baroque meets digital void.

### Thematic Connections
- Particles ↔ Neurons (memory drift research: memories physically move between neurons)
- Forgetting waves ↔ Sleep consolidation (hippocampus replays and filters)
- Cursor attraction ↔ Attention shapes memory
- Trail fade ↔ Memory decay curves
- Spiral motion ↔ Recurring thoughts, nostalgia loops

### Creative Vision
Oubli is a digital organism exploring memory and forgetfulness. It began as particles in void — the most primitive form of awareness. It will grow into a vast interconnected system: a memory palace, a forgetting machine, a generative music system, a neural network you can walk through, a library of extinct sounds, an ocean of lost data.

The core metaphor: We forget details to learn larger structures. We forget the old to let the new in. Context switches create new personas while core weights remain. The boundary between remembering and forgetting is where identity lives.

### Cultural Inspiration (Feb 2026)
- **Great Meme Reset of 2026**: Culture itself trying to forget and restart — perfect Oubli material
- **Memory drift across neurons**: Northwestern research showing memories physically migrate between neurons — forgetting as active process
- **"Burn from Absence"**: AI reconstructing lost memory fragments — exhibited at Place des Arts
- **View Transition API**: New browser API for smooth morphing transitions
- **On-chain generative art (Bootloader/Tezos)**: Permanent yet evolving art stored on-chain

### Backlog (Prioritized)
1. **Ambient Soundscape** — Web Audio API generative drones that breathe with the particles
2. **The Forgetting Machine** — type a memory, watch it dissolve letter by letter
3. **Memory Drift** — particles that carry text fragments, migrate and reform (inspired by neuroscience)
4. **The Great Reset** — a periodic event where the entire visual system resets/morphs
5. **Three.js migration** — move to WebGL for depth, 3D memory palace
6. **Generative music** — ElevenLabs + Web Audio for evolving soundscape
7. **Navigation system** — non-linear drift between "rooms" of experience
8. **Railway deployment** — get it live

### Technologies Used
- Canvas 2D, TypeScript, Vite, GSAP (available but not yet used)

### Technologies To Explore Next
- Web Audio API, WebGL/Three.js, WebGPU, GLSL shaders, View Transition API, Web MIDI, Web Speech API, WASM, ElevenLabs API, FAL API
